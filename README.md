# uk-nhs-waiting-times-capacity-insight

## Overview
This project analyses NHS Referral to Treatment waiting times across England to understand how access and backlog vary by region specialty and deprivation.  
The analysis is framed to support Trust and Integrated Care System leaders making decisions on capacity allocation and backlog reduction.

## Problem Statement
NHS waiting times have increased substantially with wide regional variation. Patients in more deprived areas often experience longer waits despite similar clinical need. Current reporting focuses on volumes rather than decision support making it difficult to identify where limited capacity investment will deliver the greatest benefit. This creates delivery risk increases inequality and delays patient care.

## Stakeholders
- NHS England / ICS leadership
- Trust operational teams
- Commissioners
- Patients and public

## Key Questions
- How do waiting times vary by region Trust and specialty?
- What is the relationship between deprivation and waiting time performance?
- Which services contribute most to backlog growth?
